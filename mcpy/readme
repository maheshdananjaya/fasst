The often referenced gcc documentation for always_inline is incomplete.

always_inline attribute makes gcc compiler:

    Ignore -fno-inline (this is what the documentation says).
    Ignore the inlining limits hence inlining the function regardless. It also inlines functions with alloca calls, which inline keyword never does.
    Not produce an external definition of a function with external linkage if marked with always_inline.

The source of the above information is gcc source code, and, hence, is subject to change with no warning.

An interesting bechmark: always_inline performance.
